							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p>
							Hey, I'm Pat, a biotechnologist from Tasmania who is passionate about One Health, comparative immunology, and antimicrobial resistance. Lover of early morning runs, DIY science, anything fermented and travel whenever I get the chance.
							</p>
							<h4 id="about"><b>BBiotechMedRes (Hons)</b></h4>
								<p>I studied my Bachelor of Biotechnology and Medical Research at my home-state University of Tasmania from 2013 to 2016, graduating with a major in Neurobiology. Over the course of this degree I was lucky to work in neuroscience, 
								stem cell and cancer-centric research groups, the latter of which I would continue with. Inspired by my time volunteering for the <a href="https://www.menzies.utas.edu.au/research/diseases-and-health-issues/research-groups/devil-facial-tumour-disease-woods-group">Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumour Disease research group</a>, I pursued my Honours study under the supervision
								of Dr. Andy Flies, investigating the structure and function of Fc receptors in the Tasmanian devil.</p>
							
							<h4><b>MSc Infectious Diseases and One Health</b></h4>
								<p>By the end of my undergraduate degree I knew that I wanted to focus my career on epidemiology, global health, and infectious disease control so I moved down the road to the 
								London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), where in 2019 I obtained a Master of Science degree with Distinction in Control of Infectious Diseases. My MSc thesis involved
								two months of fieldwork in the Peruvian Amazon (<a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/amazonian-international-center-excellence-malaria-research">Amazonian ICEMR</a>), where I investigated the effect of blood-meal source on <i> Anopheles </i> mosquito fitness and the transmission potential of <i> P. vivax </i> malaria.</p>
							
							<h4><b>PhD Integrated One Health Solutions</b></h4>
								<p>In 2019, I joined the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/edinburgh-infectious-diseases/teaching/phd-programmes/hosts-pathogens-global-health">Wellcome Trust Hosts, Pathogens, 
								and Global Health 4-year PhD Programme</a> at the University of Edinburgh. In 2020, I was awarded an MSc by Research with Distinction in light of the three independent research projects that I carried 
								out during the first year of the programme: the first on using peptide microarrays to determine the efficacy of childhood vaccinations, the second on characterising HIV-1 infections in a rural East African population,
								and the third on elucidating isometamidium chloride mode of action in <i> T. congolense.</i></p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>My PhD research builds upon the work I carried out during the second rotation of my MRes. As part of the <a href="https://hiv.bio.ed.ac.uk/index.html">Leigh Brown</a> and <a href="http://katiito.com">Atkins</a> research groups, I aim
							to use viral phylogenetics, epidemiology, and mathematical modelling to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 transmission networks in regional, national, and local epidemics, to ultimately inform the design and evaluation of HIV prevention interventions. <br />
							<br />
							In my first year, I analysed HIV-1 sequences from rural Uganda and Kenya collected during the <a href="http://www.searchendaids.com">SEARCH trial</a>, to detect phylodynamic transmission clusters arising during the trial and understand the nature of incident HIV infections within a large-scale, universal test-and-treat trial setting. This work has now been published, and the article is available <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/8/1673/htm">here</a>. Currently, I am analysing HIV-1 sequences routinely collected from HIV clinics in Kazakhstan, a Central Asian country where HIV incidence is increasing yearly, to understand where new infections are emerging from and whether certain risk groups need to receive targeted interventions. <br />
							<br />
							Imminently, I will start work on analysing HIV-1 sequences collected from persons who inject drugs (PWID) in Glasgow, UK, in an effort to update the analysis of the ongoing, local HIV outbreak amongst PWID. The work will involve linking new cases (from 2022) with earlier ones, to see where current infections are coming from and locate hotspots of infection, as well as attempting to quantify the number of undetected, "missed infections" as a result of a COVID-19 sampling pause.
